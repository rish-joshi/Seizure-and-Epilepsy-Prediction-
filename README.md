## Introduction
This is an old project created by me in the 3rd year of engineering. I suffered seizures for a long time and wanted to do something about it.

So, I downloaded a dataset from the internet, it was big (around 500MB) but it did the work. 


## Tools
- Numpy
- Pytorch

## Computation Model
I used *Neural Networks* for my task 

and for visualization, I used a *VTK* based library called *Vedo* for visualization and data exploration
## Result
I got around 83% accuracy in the prediction.
